This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over arrays. The `Bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `BugSolution.java` provides the corrected version.  The error results from the loop condition `i <= arr.length`, which attempts to access an index beyond the array's bounds. The solution adjusts the condition to `i < arr.length`, ensuring the loop iterates only within the valid index range of the array.
